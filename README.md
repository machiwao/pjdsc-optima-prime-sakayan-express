# PJDSC Optima Prime's SakayanExpress
This project proposes a framework for a dynamic bus fleet reassignment system. This system integrates advanced data analytics and real-time feedback to improve fleet
utilization, reduce overcrowding, and enhance the overall efficiency of public transportation. The system leverages GPS-enabled buses and traffic data, supported by
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, to predict demand and optimize real-time route planning.
